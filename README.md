# Tourney predictor

This is an experimental project to predict NCAA men's basketball tournament outcomes using a simple machine learning model.

## Credits

The data set was provided by Kaggle as part of the [Google Cloud & NCAAÂ® ML Competition 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018).

I used a Kaggle-provided [Jupyter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/kplauritzen/notebookde27b18258?scriptVersionId=804590) by Kasper P. Lauritzen as a starting point. 

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebook, the following is required:

* Python
* Jupyter
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn

I recommend downloading and installing Anaconda. Then, you can build a self-contained Python environment that includes all your dependencies.
